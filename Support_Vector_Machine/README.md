# Support_Vector_Machine
In machine learning, support-vector machines are supervised learning models with associated
learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked 
as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category
or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.
