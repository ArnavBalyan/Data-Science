    "# SVD for Movie Recommendations\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll detail a basic version of model-based collaborative filtering for recommendations by employing it on the MovieLens 1M dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, you used user-based and item-based collaborative filtering to make movie recommendations from users' ratings data. You could only try them on a very small data sample (20,000 ratings), and ended up getting pretty high Root Mean Squared Error (bad recommendations). Memory-based collaborative filtering approaches that compute distance relationships between items or users have these two major issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It doesn't scale particularly well to massive datasets, especially for real-time recommendations based on user behavior similarities - which takes a lot of computations.\n",
    "2. Ratings matrices may be overfitting to noisy representations of user tastes and preferences. When we use distance based \"neighborhood\" approaches on raw data, we match to sparse low-level details that we assume represent the user's preference vector instead of the vector itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus you'd need to apply **Dimensionality Reduction** technique to derive the tastes and preferences from the raw data, otherwise known as doing low-rank matrix factorization. Why reduce dimensions?\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can discover hidden correlations / features in the raw data.\n",
    "* You can remove redundant and noisy features that are not useful.\n",
    "* You can interpret and visualize the data easier.\n",
    "* You can also access easier data storage and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that goal in mind, you'll be introduced to Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD), a powerful dimensionality reduction technique that is used heavily in modern model-based CF recommender system.\n",

Specifically, there's an interpretability problem as a singular vector specifies a linear combination of all input columns or rows. There's also a lack of sparsity when the singular vectors are quite dense. Thus, SVD approach is limited to linear projections."
