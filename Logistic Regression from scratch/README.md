# Logistic Regression from scratch
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of classes. Some of the examples of classification problems are Email spam or not spam, Online transactions Fraud or not Fraud, Tumor Malignant or Benign. Logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability value.
<br> What are the types of logistic regression
1. Binary (eg. Tumor Malignant or Benign)
2. Multi-linear functions failsClass (eg. Cats, dogs or Sheep's)

## Problem Description : 

Our aim is to implement the algorithm for logistic regression without the help of any external libraries like scikit - learn.


## What is Logistic Regression? 
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for the classification problems, it is a predictive analysis algorithm and based on the concept of probability.

We can call a Logistic Regression a Linear Regression model but the Logistic Regression uses a more complex cost function, this cost function can be defined as the ‘Sigmoid function’ or also known as the ‘logistic function’ instead of a linear function. <br>
The hypothesis of logistic regression tends it to limit the cost function between 0 and 1.
