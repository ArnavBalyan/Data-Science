<h1>Polynomial Regression</h1>

<h3>Introduction To Polynomial Regression</h3>

In statistics, polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x).
Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data. For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression.

<h3>Definition and example</h3>

The goal of regression analysis is to model the expected value of a dependent variable y in terms of the value of an independent variable (or vector of independent variables) x. In simple linear regression, the model

<h3>Problem Defination</h3>
 
THe main aim to this project is to how to implement Polynomial Regression From Scratch. Here i have took example of A person approaches with a job application towards HR team. At the time of Salary negotition the applicant demands some amount for assigned job. Then the HR team look up at his past data and using this algorithm can predict his actual value and guess wether the person is saying Truth or Bluffing.
