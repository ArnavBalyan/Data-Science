We just launched a startup successfully amidst the deadliest pandemic of the past 100 years. 

While others are shutting shops and firing employees, we just hired 200+ interns and 4 full-time employees and decided to expand globally at Brand Samosa

The whole world is under lockdown, and Decodr Technologies achieved operations profitability within the first month itself.

Now, you may see some magic here, but the preparation has been on for months...even years.

Did I know about the pandemic beforehand?

Absolutely not.

But we were preparing...not for the pandemic, but for the future.

If you want to know how we are able to do it...I might share a thing or two.

Let me know in the comments section what you think are the ways...a startup can thrive through the uncertain times like these.

It would be interesting to learn from you.

“I will pay you the fees after I get a job”, tell this to your colleges and see what happens.😏

Why not?👇

They decide what you’re gonna learn - the curriculum. 😐

They decide how you’re gonna learn it - the classes, projects, homework. 😐

They decide how well you’ve learned it - exams, tests and certifications. 😐

So, THEY decide everything and then declare you “good enough” by giving you a certificate/degree. 

Then, if you don’t get a job, who failed?

You? 🤷‍♂️or they? 🤔


At Decodr Technologies we started “Pay after you get a job” programs in ML/Data Science. 

You do what we say and then it’s our responsibility - 100% 😎

P.S: we will charge you ₹5000/- at the start to ensure you have some skin in the game. ✅

Fill the form in the first comment and get a call if you qualify for this. 👇

I am conducting a lot of interviews these days.😇

While there are some wonderful people we are hiring, I particularly have a question to freshers.👇

If your colleges promised you sky-high packages once you complete their course, it means they SOLD their course to you. 🙄

You believed it and then handed over your career's responsibility to them. You didn't build practical skills that we in the industry need. 🤓🧐

Trust me, the industry doesn't care what you were promised.

We will test you based on your skills and the overall value you can bring into the organisation.✅

Well, we can teach you. But there is a cost to it.

Ask yourself,

You paid your colleges a lot of money to teach you. But you want the companies to pay you for teaching you.🤔

Isn't that strange?

Life is all about trade-offs. You gotta choose and pay the price.🙏

I have developed my first Machine Learning exhaustive project as a part of Data Analytics & Machine Learning internship at Decodr Technologies. 

The project is about predicting a financial organization will give loan to its customers or not on the basis of some other features of the customers.

I used 4 different models to train my data and compared them
a) logistic regression
b) KNeighborsClassifier
C) SVC
d) DecisionTreeClassifier

I prepared this model using Python Programming language and Spyder IDE.

Classrooms turn into bedrooms as they sleep on floor for next 60 nights. Mornings start at 4 am and books occupy their minds till late night 1 AM. 😍

The sheer discipline and focus these young boys and girls from poor families displayed during my interactions with them, re-assured my faith in the Greatness on this Nation.🙏

Some encouraged and others made fun of us - doubting the intentions. It was FREE after all.

The first batch received 170+ applications. We selected 13.

Super glad to proceed through the first stage...here is some behind the scene action of NEXEL Launchpad 1.0 by NEXEL World

I am happy that young entrepreneurs are learning the real stuff. 

Join me on this journey. Let me know if you wanna be a mentor in upcoming programs or want to contribute in other ways.

⭕ The heavily hyped, self-driving Google car? The essence of machine learning. 🚗

⭕ Online recommendation offers such as those from Amazon and Netflix? Machine learning applications for everyday life.🖥️

⭕ Knowing what customers are saying about you on Twitter? Machine learning combined with linguistic rule creation.

⭕ Fraud detection? One of the more obvious, important uses in our world today.💰

January 2018. 

I was on a 5000+ km road trip across small towns and villages across India.

People kept asking what is my "solution" as I aggressively talked about the hopeless situation of our young generation.

Since then I set up and grew NEXEL World, Brand Samosa and now Decodr Technologies.

With one mission...."Changing the world through Entrepreneurship and Leadership".

Ask me what we are doing and how we can join hands together.

We were not born just to pay our bills. There is a better way to live our lives.

There was no response to my call on social media. 😬

It was late January 2018 and I had just come back from a 5000 km road journey. 

What I experienced during the trip made me do something immediately for the young generation of our country. 🦸‍♂️

So I called out all stake holders to partner in building entrepreneurship eco system in tier 2/3 cities of India. My messages on social media went largely unheard. 🙄

It was then I decided to make my voice heard and reach to all the stake holders personally. 😎

From 10k to 55k network in Social media, past 18 months have been legendary. 😇

Made many lifetime friends and achieved worth of a lifetime of wisdom. 🙏

Brand Samosa, NEXEL World, Decodr Technologies and many other initiatives were born. 

If you are still not going all out on social especially LinkedIn, you will regret it for the rest of your life. 😏

This is your tool to tell an epic tale. ✅

Just remember your mission. You’ll need that to pull you through the dark days. 🏃🏻‍♂️

Comment below and let me know what’s your mission. Maybe we can collaborate.🤝

And if you need help on LinkedIn, I’m all ears. Let me know. 👍

"Graduated from college, but what to do next? "

Sheetal, my friend, was very confused after graduating from "name of college".


This is the biggest dilemma we are facing nowadays. I have come across many people who took engineering because their parents want them to be an engineer or because of other reasons. 


Selecting the course of parent's choice in graduation is one thing, but now is the time to take the call and do what you love.

How many people have taken engineering because of their parent's wish and not by their will? 

Comment below👇🏻. We would love to hear from you😊
