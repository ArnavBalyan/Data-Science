# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance

## Problem Statement:
Predict attrition of your valuable employees.

## Description:
**Ensemble Methods**
 Ensemble methods is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model. A Decision Tree determines the predictive value based on series of questions and conditions. 

## DATA:
Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.

## Libraries used:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
- XGBoost
- Plotly

## Algorithm:
Gradient Boosting Regression
XGBoost
RandomForestClassifier

## Steps involved:
1. Importing relevant python Libraries
2. Exploring the Dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Preprocessing
5. Model Building
6. Validation
7. Conclusion

## Conclusion:
We have constructed a very simple pipeline of predicting employee attrition, from some basic Exploratory Data Analysis to feature engineering as well as implementing two learning models in the form of a Random Forest and a Gradient Boosting classifier. This whole notebook takes less than a minute to run and it even returns a 89% accuracy in its predictions.
