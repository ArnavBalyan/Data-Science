# E Coli Dataset:

## Background:

E Coli Escherichia coli, also known as E. coli, is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms.

In this project, we'll be observing the data available through the E Coli dataset available on Kaggle. 
 
## Dataset Description:

The dataset has 336 entries with 9 columns. The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kannanaikkal/ecoli-uci-dataset) which was originally contributed by [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ecoli).

## Run:

The entire coding is done by using the jupyter notebook. It can be installed by following the steps given in this [link](https://jupyter.org/install). 

## Algorithm:

The dataset can be dealt with various models. Here I am using the KNN Classifier and the and Support Vector Machine to predict the data and compare them.  

### KNN Classifier:

K-nearest neighbor algorithm (K-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether K-NN is used for classification or regression. 

### Support Vector Machine: 

Support-vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting).
