# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

## Problem Statement:
Predict the House price using Advanced Regression Techniquies.

## Description:
**Stacking Model Approach**
Model stacking is an efficient ensemble method in which the predictions, generated by using various machine learning algorithms, are used as inputs in a second-layer learning algorithm. This second-layer algorithm is trained to optimally combine the model predictions to form a new set of predictions.

## DATA:
File description:
train.csv - the training set
test.csv - the test set
data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here
sample_submission.csv - a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms

## Libraries used:
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Sklearn
XGBoost
Lightgbm

## Algorithm:
ElasticNet Regression 
Lasso Regression
Kernel Ridge Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression
XGBoost
LightGBM

## Steps involved:
1. Importing relevant python Libraries
2. Exploring the Dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Preprocessing
5. Model Building
6. Validation
7. Conclusion
