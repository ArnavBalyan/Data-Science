# Linear Regression


Linear Regression is one of the easiest algorithms in machine learning. In this notebook, this algorithm wil be explored and implemented using Python from scratch.
As the name suggests this algorithm is applicable for Regression problems. Linear Regression is a Linear Model. Which means, establishing a linear relationship between the input variables(X) and single output variable(Y). When the input(X) is a single variable this model is called Simple Linear Regression and when there are mutiple input variables(X), it is called Multiple Linear Regression.
